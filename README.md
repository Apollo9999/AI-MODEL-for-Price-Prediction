Title: Predicting Accurate Shipping Costs Using Intel ONE API and Intel OPENVINO for Logistics: The PriceAI Model

Abstract: Predicting accurate shipping costs is a crucial aspect of logistics management, impacting both businesses and customers. Traditional methods of estimating shipping costs often fall short, especially when faced with the complexities of diverse shipment details, geographical variances, and fluctuating economic factors. This research article presents PriceAI, an advanced AI-driven solution designed to predict and forecast shipping costs using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Intel ONE API and Intel OPENVINO, this comprehensive framework integrates real-world datasets, accounting for multiple parameters to deliver precise cost predictions. The solution also includes a user-friendly interface and API integrations for enterprise use. This paper explores the methodology, tools, and processes that make PriceAI a scalable and effective solution for shipping cost prediction.

Introduction
The logistics industry is constantly evolving, with businesses requiring efficient, accurate, and real-time predictions for shipping costs to ensure cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction. Shipping costs are influenced by various factors such as shipment weight, distance, fuel prices, geopolitical factors, and seasonal demand. Traditional methods often rely on static models that fail to incorporate dynamic, real-world data. The need for a robust AI-based model has become paramount in delivering more accurate shipping cost predictions.

In this research, we introduce PriceAI, a machine learning model designed to predict shipping costs with high accuracy. Using Intel ONE API and Intel OPENVINO, PriceAI leverages the computational power and efficiency of Intel's AI suite to create a highly optimized and scalable model.
